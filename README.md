# CL-Repo-Project1
Concept
I want to create a fun & stylized web experienced revolving around a character I created named Penny. I haven't decided what the interaction will be exactly, but want to include a fluid 3D UI/UX flow with very simple navigation. 
Initial Wireframes

Creating a wireframe was harder than I thought, especially since most of my visuals will be image & 3D animation based by the end.
